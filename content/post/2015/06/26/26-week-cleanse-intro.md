So someone has introduced me to something called the *26 Week Cleanse*. It boils
down to getting rid of one item the first week, two items the second week, and so
on until you've completed 26 weeks (hence the name). Rather than following that
timeline however, I plan to get rid of stuff in batches.

```
sum(1...n) = (n * (n+1)) / 2
sum(1...26) = (26 * 27) / 2
sum(1...26) = 351
```

So that's the ultimate target -- I have to get rid of 351 things.

I'll be documenting my progress as I work towards this. I'll update item counts
and I'll try to include photos if I have time. Obviously, I'll also try to find
a new home for any items I get rid of, rather than blindly throwing them out.
Just because *I* don't need my old textbooks doesn't mean that they can't find
new purpose in the hands of someone else.

Starting the *26 Week Cleanse* on the 26th. It's also apparently the 26th week
of the year? Well then. The numbers hath spoken. You can always count on numbers\.\.\.

*(drumroll)*

### The Items
`1`: One DJ turntable (Going back to the friend I borrowed it from)  
`2-3`: Two sets of bedsheets (Donating)  
`4-6`: Three old shampoo/bodywash bottles that were tucked in a corner  
`7-10`: Four bottles of expired supplements  
`11-15`: Five reusable bags (Donating)  
`16-21`: Six textbooks (Donating)  
`22-28`: Seven random sweaters (Donating)  
`29-36`: Eight bags/boxes of bottles (How\.\.\.?)

I would've loved to be able to sell the textbooks, but it turns out that tech
textbooks tend to lose their value *really* fast, so each would only sell for
about $6.

So that's 36 items down, or about 10%. Not a bad start, but I know my progress
is about to slow down drastically as I look for more and more items to get rid
of. I wish I had done this when I first moved out, as I would've been done in a
day or two, although I suppose I *did* do it already, just not officially.
