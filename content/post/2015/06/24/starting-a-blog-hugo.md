*Cue clich√© opening line:* So I've decided to start a blog\.\.\.

I intend this to be a place where I can keep track of my thoughts on tech, photography, wine, personal projects, and pretty much anything else that tickles my fancy.

Rather than having to be concerned about WordPress security issues, I've opted to go the route of a static site. The dominant players seem to be [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (Ruby) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) (Go). Hugo seems to render the site far faster than Jekyll can, so I'm going with Hugo for now.

So far it's been considerably more of a headache than another WP install would've been, but I'm hoping it pays off in the long run. In all fairness I had comparable headaches when I first started using WP, so I can probably chalk this up to initial learning curve woes and fiddling with themes to get things the way I want them.

*(One day elapses)*

After switching themes, I've found one I don't have to fight with. Done and done. Hugo is now getting out of my way and just letting me focus on content for you fine (likely imaginary) readers.
